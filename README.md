# CIS250-Stack-Trace
Demonstrates a stack trace algorithm.

Two stacks are made: S and T. First, S is filled by pushing integers onto the stack. The top of S is revealed in the console. Then each item in S is poped off and pushed into T. The top of T is then shown to show how the stack has been reversed.
